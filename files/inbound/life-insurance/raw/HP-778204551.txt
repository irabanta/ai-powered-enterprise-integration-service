Dear Mrs. Donnelly,

We are pleased to welcome you to HarborPoint Mutual Insurance following the successful issuance of your policy. Our records reflect that your profile, registered under policy number HP-778204551, has been activated effective 15 October 2025. During your application, you confirmed your date of birth as 03 May 1984, and your Social Security Number ending in 6721, which ensures correct identification for future correspondence. As a female policyholder, your eligibility and benefits have been validated under our Individual Comprehensive Protection plan.

Your coverage is now active and structured to provide financial assurance in unforeseen circumstances. The documents associated with your policy, including coverage schedules and premium terms, will be dispatched via email within the next two business days. Please carefully review those documents once received, especially the declaration section, to confirm all personal details such as your name, Aisha Donnelly, and date of birth have been correctly captured. If any part of your information—including your SSN or identification details—appears inaccurate, kindly reach out to our service desk immediately so we may update your records and issue corrected endorsements.

We respectfully remind you to retain your policy number, HP-778204551, as it will be required when submitting claims or verifying benefits. Your first premium payment is scheduled to process at the end of this month. Should you wish to explore additional riders or modify beneficiary preferences, our advisors are available to guide you through the process.

We appreciate your trust in HarborPoint Mutual and are committed to providing clarity, stability, and responsive support throughout your journey with us. Thank you once again for choosing us to protect what matters most. We look forward to serving you with diligence and care.
